# Internet-Computing-COP3813-
A compilation of the applications and websites I made/used in intro to online computing. A working version can be found on https://lamp.cse.fau.edu/~imallarino2015.

Each project is separated in to its own folder entitled p1-p7.

p1 deals only with the static languages: html5 and css.

p2 introduces bootstrap.

p3 is the first project dealing with the dynamic, albeit still client-side, side of the web languages.  Namely javascript.

p4 uses one of the available javascript classes, jquery.

p5 introduces the server-side element of the web languages via php. 

p6 works with mysql and database handling.

p7 is a final compilation of all of the aforementioned languages to create a site complete with minor security, user-uploaded content, account-specific pages, and dynamic handling of web elements.
